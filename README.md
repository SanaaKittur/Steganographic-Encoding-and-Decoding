# Steganographic-Encoding-and-Decoding
Encoding data to be steganographed in an image and decoding that same data from that image
# About
* Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection. 
* The secret data is then extracted at its destination. 
* The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data.
* Here, this project focuses on Image Steganography.
# Image Steganography
* Image Steganography is the process of hiding the information which can be text, image or video inside a cover image.
* The secret information is hidden in a way that is not visible to a human eye.
* The most widely used technique to hide the secret bit is to hide itinside the LSB of a cover image.
* This method uses bits of each pixel in the image.
* Pixel is a minute area of illumination on a display screen, one of many from which an image is composed.
# Implementation
*  By calling the main function, there are two options for the user - Encoding and Decoding.
*  If the user wants to Encode the data into the image, then choose option 1 and give the name of the image to be encoded, and the extension of the image must be mentioned.
*  If the user wants to Decode the data from the image which was encoded, choose option 2 and give the name of that image from which the encoded data has to be decoded.
*  Not to forget to mention the extension of the data.
